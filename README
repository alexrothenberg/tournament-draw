Manage a single-elimination tournament draw (like a tennis tournament or the NCAA March Madness).

This is currently very rough and needs to be cleaned up if it goes forward

============= TO DOs

* UI needs work
* Tests needed
* UI for loading player names
* If you don't have a power-of-2 number of players need to decide how to allocate byes fairly
* Should it host more than 1 tournament?

============= To Use
Initialize your data
* Edit the file lib/names.txt
* Run 'rake create_tournament
Run
* Start your server
http://localhost:3000/  will show the draw.  Games that have 2 players (the previous game was decided) are links you can click to assign a winner
http://localhost:3000/players is scaffolding to let you manage players (change names is all that makes sense)
